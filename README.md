##  About Me

I’m a Computer Science student with hands-on experience in cybersecurity, networking, and software development, currently working as a **GRC Analyst Intern**. I enjoy applying technical concepts to real-world security problems, whether that’s evaluating security controls, building proof-of-concepts, or experimenting in my home lab.

My interests include **cyber defense, risk management, penetration testing, automation, and systems engineering**. I’m actively seeking cybersecurity or computer science internships where I can continue learning and contributing to impactful security initiatives.
